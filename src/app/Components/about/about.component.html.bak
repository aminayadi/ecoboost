      EcoBoost Enzyme Fuel Treatment powered by XBEE Technology is a
      breakthrough enzyme composite that increases fuel efficiency, power output
      and reduces greenhouse gas emissions with 0% harm - unlike other fuel
      additives

    EcoBoost™ Enzyme Fuel Treatment delivers commendable benefits in terms of
    improved combustion from spark-ignition engines, road diesel engines, gas
    turbines, heavy marine diesel, commercial and power station boilers.
  </p>

  <p class="text-l">
    When added to liquid fossil fuel oils, in small amounts, EcoBoost enzymes
    break up the long-chain hydrocarbons and contaminants that prevent clean
    efficient combustion.
  </p>

  <p class="text-l">
    EXB's theory is straightforward; a more complete burn gives a greater power
    output. A cleaner burn proportionately reduces CO2, CO, HC, SOx, NOx and
    particulate emissions.
  </p>

  <p class="text-l">
    In Ghana, Cote D'Ivoire, Nigeria, Senegal, Togo, and 12 other ECOWAS African
    countries EcoBoost™ is distributed exclusively by Lumiere Group
    International. in Ghana.

        All fuels are inherently dirty, otherwise there would be no need for

      </p>
      <p class="text-item left-text">
        Engines may perform poorly due to filterability, stale fuel or
        contamination. A fuel free of contaminants combusts more completely
        which increases thermal efficiency.

        "All across the world, increasingly dangerous weather patterns are
        abruptly putting an end to the long-running debate over whether or not
        climate change is real. Not only is it real, it's here, and its effects
        are giving rise to a frighteningly new global phenomenon: the man-made
        natural disaster." ~Barack Obama

        EcoBoost treated fuels exhibit lower emissions of Green House Gas in the
        form of CO conversion to CO2 which in turn is reduced through improved
        combustion.

      <p class="text-item left-text">
        Unburnt hydrocarbons ( HC) particulates and black smoke are
        significantly reduced. Reduction in NOx comes from changes in flame
        temperature and air used in the combustion process.
